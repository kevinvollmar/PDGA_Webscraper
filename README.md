# PDGA_Webscraper
PDGA event webscraper. I am primarily using this to track Tour Card status and eligibility for DGPT players.

PDGA_Webscraper.py goes to the PDGA's website and webscrapes the tables for the event URL specified. This information is then stored in a file that is created, called housing.csv. From there the information can be saved as a CSV file for the specific event and the data can be uploaded to the Google Sheets document that stores this information. The sheet then uses this data to determine which pros are qualified, or are in position to qualify, for a Tour Card.

The linked website in the information about this repository will take you to the Google Site that embeds this Tour Card Tracking file.
